- **Example**: If you have a tax rate in cell B1 and wish to apply it to multiple rows of income in column A, using `=$B$1` in your formula ensures that all calculations refer back to the tax rate in B1.

### Relative Referencing

- **Syntax**: `=A1`
- **Usage**: Relative references change based on the relative position of rows and columns. When you copy a formula with a relative reference, the reference adjusts automatically. This is ideal for operations that need to be replicated across multiple cells or rows.
- **Example**: To calculate the sum of values in columns A and B for each row, a formula in column C like `=A1 + B1` can be copied down the column, automatically adjusting to `=A2 + B2`, `=A3 + B3`, and so on.

### Mixed Referencing

- **Syntax**: `=$A1` or `=A$1`
- **Usage**: Mixed referencing combines absolute and relative references by locking either the row or the column. This approach is valuable for formulas that need to maintain a fixed reference to a particular row or column across a range of cells.
- **Example**: If you're calculating values in a table where you need to fix the column reference but allow the row reference to change, `=$A1` can be copied across columns without changing the column reference 'A'. Conversely, `=A$1` can be copied down rows without changing the row reference '1'.
